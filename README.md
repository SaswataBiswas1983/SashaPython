# My Python Project for CareerFoundry
## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products
## TASK
My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.
## Key Questions
•	What are the peak order times and days?
•	When do customers tend to spend the most?
•	How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
•	Which product departments are most popular?
•	How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?
## Data Set: The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.
